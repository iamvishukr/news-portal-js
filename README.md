# news-portal-js
It is a news portal that i have made using HTML, CSS, Javascript . I have used NEWS API in this project. Since the newsapi.org api in developer plan is no more working in production, so i wasn't able to upload it using netlify. So i have uploaded the Screenshots of my project which is from the localhost.
